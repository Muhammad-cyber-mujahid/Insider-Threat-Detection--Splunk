Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a malicious technique where attackers inject harmful scripts, typically JavaScript, into web applications to execute in a userâ€™s browser, compromising their interaction with the site. 

Identifying XSS attack

To identify XSS attempts in the logs, focus on web_access events with threat_indicator=XSS, indicating malicious scripts in url_path. 
A specific url_path example from the log is https://nexlify.com/search?q=<script>alert('xss')</script>.

Other Signs to Notice XSS Attacks  

i) url_path containing JavaScript keywords like <script>, alert, prompt, or onerror.  
ii) Unusual HTTP responses, such as status_code=200 with malicious payloads, indicating successful script execution.


Scenarios to Check for XSS attack

1. List ip_address, status_code, and url_path for XSS attempts:
